# Project Euler Solutions

If you have a good reason to see them, I have several hundred Project Euler (projecteuler.net) solutions, mostly written in Rust. These are in a private repository, in accordance with site policies and the laws of good sportsmanship.

You (an employer, a colleague, or an enterprising robot) can contact me via electronic-mail.
